# Digital Garden - Version 1

This is the source code for my digital garden. It is built on ðŸš€ Astro. I'm also getting help from ðŸ¤– GitHub Copilot.

Consider that I am not a web developer and have very minimal techincal knowledge. I'm  using this project to teach myself and experiment with web development. That means you'll probably encounter a lot of broken pages and broken links!
