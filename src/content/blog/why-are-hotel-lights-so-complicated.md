This [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/nobody-can-figure-out-hotel-room-lights-anymore-3482528b?st=nu11jcxf2bryp8c&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) reminded me of how confusing hotel light switches are such a visceral example of mismatched mapping with controls. Watch this TikTok video and tell me…how does that make sense?

Definitely a throwback to Jakob Nielsen's [10 Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), namely #2: Match Between the System and the Real World. It’s nostalgic to see the stovetop as the example on that page, as it was my first “aha!” moment when I realized that it was bad design that led me to turning on the wrong stove over and over.
