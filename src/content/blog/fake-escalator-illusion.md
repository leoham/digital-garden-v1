As I’ve [written about before](https://www.leoham.com/cured-ham-blog/2024/8/9/all-star-by-smash-mouth-played-in-zelda-majoras-mask), I think YouTube is at its best with random innocent humor.

Not sure why the algorithm showed me this video today—but I’m sure you’ll enjoy it as much as I did. You _know_ I’ll be trying to do this fake escalator trick next time I encounter hidden stairs.
